  "introduction": "<p class=\"lead text-xl text-stone-700 mb-6\"><strong>Of the five elements, Earth is the foundation. It heals, cools, and absorbs.</strong></p><p class=\"mb-4\">Mud Therapy involves applying moist, mineral-rich earth to the body. It might sound simple, but the therapeutic effects are profound. Mud has the unique property of holding moisture and coolness for a long time. When applied to the body, it draws out toxic heat (inflammation) and absorbs morbid matter through the pores.</p><p class=\"mb-4\">At Delhi Wellness Haven, we use specially treated clay from 3-4 feet below the ground, which is free from impurities and rich in minerals.</p>",
