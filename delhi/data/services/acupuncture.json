  "introduction": "<p class=\"lead text-xl text-stone-700 mb-6\"><strong>Unblock your energy, unleash your health.</strong></p><p class=\"mb-4\">Acupuncture is a key component of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) that has been validated by modern science. It involves the insertion of hair-thin, sterile needles into specific points on the body. These points lie on energy channels called 'Meridians'.</p><p class=\"mb-4\">From a modern perspective, Acupuncture stimulates the nervous system to release chemicals like endorphins (natural painkillers) and serotonin (mood boosters) into the muscles, spinal cord, and brain. At Delhi Wellness Haven, we use it primarily for pain management and nervous system regulation.</p>",

Most people feel a tiny prick or an ant-bite sensation upon insertion, followed by a dull ache or tingling (called 'De Qi') which indicates the energy has been accessed. It is <strong>not</strong> painful like a hypodermic injection.</p>"
