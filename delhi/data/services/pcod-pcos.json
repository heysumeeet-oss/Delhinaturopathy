  "introduction": "<p class=\"lead text-xl text-stone-700 mb-6\"><strong>Hormonal balance is your body's natural rhythm. Let's tune it back to perfection.</strong></p><p class=\"mb-4\">Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) or Disease (PCOD) is now affecting 1 in 5 women in India. It is not just a reproductive issue; it is a metabolic disorder closely linked to Insulin Resistance. The conventional route of prescribing contraceptive pills gives you a 'withdrawal bleed', not a real period, and often masks the problem while it worsens internally.</p><p class=\"mb-4\">Our <strong>PCOD/PCOS Reversal Program</strong> treats the root causes: Insulin Resistance, Chronic Inflammation, and Adrenal Stress. We help you shed the stubborn weight, clear your skin (acne), stop hair fall, and most importantly, restore your natural, ovulatory menstrual cycle.</p>",

      "content": "<h4 class=\"text-lg font-bold text-stone-800 mt-6 mb-3\">1. Seed Cycling Protocol</h4><p class=\"mb-4\">We guide you on using specific seeds to mimic the body's natural estrogen and progesterone phases.</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4 text-stone-700 mb-6\"><li><strong>Phase 1 (Follicular):</strong> Flax & Pumpkin seeds to boost Estrogen and clear excess hormones.</li><li><strong>Phase 2 (Luteal):</strong> Sesame & Sunflower seeds to boost Progesterone and support implantation/period health.</li></ul><h4 class=\"text-lg font-bold text-stone-800 mt-6 mb-3\">2. Mud Packs for Pelvic Health</h4><p class=\"mb-4\">Applying a cold mud pack to the lower abdomen helps in reducing pelvic congestion and inflammation in the ovaries/uterus. It is highly effective for reducing period pain and regulating flow.</p><h4 class=\"text-lg font-bold text-stone-800 mt-6 mb-3\">3. Yoga for Fertility</h4><p class=\"mb-4\">Certain asanas increase blood flow to the reproductive organs:</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4 text-stone-700 mb-6\"><li><strong>Baddhakonasana (Butterfly Pose):</strong> Opens up the pelvic region.</li><li><strong>Surya Namaskar:</strong> Improves overall metabolism and weight loss.</li><li><strong>Supta Baddhakonasana:</strong> Restorative pose for stress relief.</li></ul><h4 class=\"text-lg font-bold text-stone-800 mt-6 mb-3\">4. Diet Correction</h4><p class=\"mb-4\">A low-GI diet is non-negotiable for PCOS. Eliminating dairy and gluten is often recommended as they can be inflammatory triggers for many women with hormonal issues.</p>"

      "question": "Will my facial hair (hirsutism) go away?",
      "answer": "As insulin levels drop and testosterone reduces, new hair growth slows down and becomes finer. Existing coarse hair may need removal, but the 'growth' stops."
