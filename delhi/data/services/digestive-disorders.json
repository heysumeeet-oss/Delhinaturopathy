The digestive system is not just a food pipe; it is your 'Second Brain'. Imbalances here lead to anxiety, skin issues, autoimmune diseases, and chronic fatigue.</p><p class=\"mb-4\">Our <strong>Digestive Disorder Treatment</strong> focuses on the 4 R's: Remove (toxins), Replace (enzymes), Reinoculate (good bacteria), and Repair (gut lining). We successfully treat conditions like IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome), GERD (Acid Reflux), Chronic Constipation, and Bloating.</p>",

Hydrotherapy (Hip Bath & Enema)</h4><p class=\"mb-4\">A <strong>Hip Bath</strong> diverts blood flow to the pelvic region, relieving constipation and gas. A therapeutic <strong>Enema</strong> (using water, buttermilk, or oil) helps in washing out old fecal matter that releases toxins into the bloodstream.</p><h4 class=\"text-lg font-bold text-stone-800 mt-6 mb-3\">2. Mud Packs</h4><p class=\"mb-4\">Applying a cold mud pack to the abdomen is a miracle cure for Acidity and Ulcers. It absorbs the internal heat (Pitta) and soothes the inflamed lining of the stomach.</p><h4 class=\"text-lg font-bold text-stone-800 mt-6 mb-3\">3. Diet: The Elimination Protocol</h4><p class=\"mb-4\">We help you identify food intolerances (gluten, dairy, soy) that might be silently damaging your gut. We then introduce healing foods like bone broth (or vegan equivalent), fermented foods (kanji), and soothing teas.</p>"

      "question": "Is an enema safe/habit forming?",
      "answer": "Therapeutic enemas given for a short duration during a detox are not habit-forming. They are different from laxatives which irritate the bowel. Enemas mechanically clean the colon."

    {
      "question": "Can you cure severe acidity/GERD?",
      "answer": "Yes. By correcting the stomach acid levels (often low acid causes reflux, not high!) and strengthening the esophageal sphincter, we can reverse GERD."
