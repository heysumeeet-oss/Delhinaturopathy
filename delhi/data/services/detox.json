Over time, these toxins accumulate in our fat cells and organs, leading to chronic fatigue, brain fog, skin breakouts, and lowered immunity.</p><p class=\"mb-4\">Our <strong>Detoxification Program</strong> is a systematic medical cleanse. It is not a starving fad diet. It is a supported process of mobilizing toxins from tissues and eliminating them through the 4 main channels: Skin, Lungs, Kidneys, and Colon.</p>",

      "question": "Will I feel weak during detox?",
      "answer": "You might feel a 'healing crisis' (headache, fatigue) for the first 24-48 hours as caffeine/sugar withdrawal hits. After that, most patients report a surge in energy and clarity."

      "answer": "We recommend a short 3-day detox at every change of season (Ritu Sandhi), and a deeper 7-10 day cleanse once a year."
