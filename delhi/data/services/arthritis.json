Don't let Arthritis stop you.</strong></p><p class=\"mb-4\">Arthritis and chronic joint pain can debilitatingly affect your quality of life.

At Delhi Wellness Haven, we offer a safe, effective, and non-invasive alternative.</p><p class=\"mb-4\">Our <strong>Arthritis & Pain Relief Program</strong> is designed to reduce inflammation, lubricate the joints, and strengthen the supporting muscles. We use a combination of thermal therapies, herbal applications, and specific exercises to restore your mobility.</p>",

      "content": "<p class=\"mb-4\">We use nature's elements to fight pain:</p><h4 class=\"text-lg font-bold text-stone-800 mt-6 mb-3\">1. Potli Massage (Herbal Bolus Therapy)</h4><p class=\"mb-4\">Small herbal pouches (Potlis) dipped in hot medicated oil are patted over the painful joints. The heat reduces stiffness, while the herbs penetrate the skin to reduce inflammation locally. This is excellent for Spondylitis and Back Pain.</p><h4 class=\"text-lg font-bold text-stone-800 mt-6 mb-3\">2. Mud Therapy (Local Application)</h4><p class=\"mb-4\">For acute inflammation (red, hot, swollen joints), we use cold mud packs. The mud absorbs the excess heat and toxins accumulated in the joint, providing instant relief from throbbing pain.</p><h4 class=\"text-lg font-bold text-stone-800 mt-6 mb-3\">3. Steam & Sauna Bath</h4><p class=\"mb-4\">Generalized sweating helps in eliminating metabolic waste (like uric acid) that often crystallizes in joints, causing gout and pain.</p><h4 class=\"text-lg font-bold text-stone-800 mt-6 mb-3\">4. Janu Basti (Knee Therapy)</h4><p class=\"mb-4\">A reservoir is made of dough around the knee, and warm medicated oil is pooled in it. This deeply nourishes and lubricates the knee joint, acting like a 'natural knee replacement' strategy for early stages of OA.</p>"

      "question": "Can Naturopathy cure Rheumatoid Arthritis?",
      "answer": "RA is an autoimmune condition. While a complete 'cure' is difficult, we can induce long-term remission, meaning you can live without pain and minimal medication."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is massage safe for inflamed joints?",
      "answer": "In acute inflammation (swelling/heat), deep tissue massage is avoided. We use gentle lymphatic drainage or cooling applications. Once inflammation subsides, massage helps restore mobility."
