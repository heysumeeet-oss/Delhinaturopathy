  "introduction": "<p class=\"lead text-xl text-stone-700 mb-6\"><strong>Water is the world's first medicine.</strong></p><p class=\"mb-4\">Hydrotherapy is the application of water at varying temperatures (hot, cold, neutral) and states (liquid, steam, ice) to produce physiological changes in the body. It relies on the body's reaction to these thermal stimuli: Cold water constricts blood vessels (invigorating), while hot water dilates them (relaxing). Alternating them creates a pumping action that boosts circulation and immunity.</p><p class=\"mb-4\">At Delhi Wellness Haven, our Hydrotherapy wing is equipped with specialized tubs, jets, and sprays to treat everything from back pain to insomnia.</p>",

      "content": "<p class=\"mb-4\">Water has high specific heat and conductivity. When applied to the skin, it influences blood distribution. For example, a cold bath drives blood from the skin to the internal organs (improving organ function), while a hot pack draws blood to the surface (relieving deep congestion).</p>"
