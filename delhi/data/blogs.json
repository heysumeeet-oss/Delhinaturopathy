In a bustling metropolis like Delhi, where lifestyle diseases are rampant, finding a natural path to health is more crucial than ever.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"mb-6\">\n        We believe that <strong>Type 2 Diabetes is manageable</strong> through disciplined lifestyle changes. It is often a result of metabolic imbalance, and what has been disrupted can be restored. With over 18 years of experience, Dr. Rajesh Verma has guided numerous individuals towards a healthier, more balanced life.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"mb-6\">\n        Our approach isn't about quick fixes but sustainable health. We focus on resetting your metabolic rhythm through a scientific, nature-based protocol.\n    </p>\n\n    <div class=\"bg-light-gray p-6 rounded-lg border border-light-gray/70 my-8\">\n        <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-serif text-primary-blue mb-4\" id=\"table-of-contents\">Table of Contents</h2>\n        <ul class=\"list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-dark-gray\">\n            <li><a href=\"#understanding-diabetes\" class=\"hover:text-primary-blue transition-colors\">Beyond Sugar: Understanding Insulin Resistance</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"#delhi-lifestyle\" class=\"hover:text-primary-blue transition-colors\">Urban Living & Metabolic Health</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"#naturopathic-protocol\" class=\"hover:text-primary-blue transition-colors\">Our 5-Step Holistic Protocol</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"#diet-chart\" class=\"hover:text-primary-blue transition-colors\">Nutritional Guidelines for Diabetics</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"#yoga-stress\" class=\"hover:text-primary-blue transition-colors\">Movement & Mindfulness</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"#success-stories\" class=\"hover:text-primary-blue transition-colors\">Patient Testimonials</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"#faq\" class=\"hover:text-primary-blue transition-colors\">Common Questions</a></li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n\n    <h2 id=\"understanding-diabetes\" class=\"text-3xl font-serif font-bold text-dark-gray mt-12 mb-6\">Beyond Sugar: Understanding Insulin Resistance</h2>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">\n        Diabetes is often misunderstood as merely a sugar problem. In reality, it is a complex issue of <strong>Insulin Resistance</strong>. High blood sugar is a symptom, not the sole cause.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">\n        Think of insulin as a key that unlocks your cells to let energy in. When resistance occurs, the lock is jammed. Sugar remains in the bloodstream, causing damage, while your cells starve.\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"bg-primary-light/20 p-6 rounded-xl border-l-4 border-primary-blue my-6\">\n        <h4 class=\"font-bold text-primary-blue mb-2\">The Naturopathic Perspective</h4>\n        <p class=\"text-dark-gray\">\n            We view this resistance as a result of accumulated toxicity or 'Morbid Matter'. Contributing factors include:\n            <br>1. Processed and refined foods\n            <br>2. Chronic stress\n            <br>3. Lack of physical movement\n            <br>4. Environmental toxins\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">\n        Our aim is to detoxify the system, essentially 'cleaning the lock' so your body's natural insulin can function effectively again.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"delhi-lifestyle\" class=\"text-3xl font-serif font-bold text-dark-gray mt-12 mb-6\">Urban Living & Metabolic Health</h2>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">\n        Delhi's vibrant culture is a delight, but its modern lifestyle can be taxing on health. Rich foods and sedentary jobs are common.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">\n        Many of our patients from areas like <strong>Green Park</strong> and <strong>Greater Kailash</strong> face the challenge of long working hours and limited physical activity.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">\n        <strong>Breaking the Cycle:</strong> Recognizing that our environment contributes to health issues is the first step. Making conscious choices to walk more, eat fresh, and manage stress is vital.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"naturopathic-protocol\" class=\"text-3xl font-serif font-bold text-dark-gray mt-12 mb-6\">Our 5-Step Holistic Protocol</h2>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">\n        At <em>Delhi Wellness Haven</em>, we offer a structured program designed to support your body's healing process:\n    </p>\n\n    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-dark-gray/70 mt-6 mb-3\">1. Abdominal Packs</h3>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">\n        Cooling mud packs applied to the abdomen help reduce internal heat and improve circulation to the digestive organs, supporting pancreatic function.\n    </p>\n\n    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-dark-gray/70 mt-6 mb-3\">2. Hydrotherapy</h3>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">\n        Techniques like the Hip Bath stimulate the abdominal region, aiding digestion and metabolism. This can be particularly effective for reducing visceral fat.\n    </p>\n\n    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-dark-gray/70 mt-6 mb-3\">3. Natural Bitter Tonics</h3>\n    <p class=\"mb-4\">\n        Ingredients like Karela (Bitter Gourd) and Jamun are known for their beneficial properties in regulating blood sugar.
